This is my Hummingbot algorithmic project folder!
1. My trade logic can be found in the Word document titled "James Directional Bot_with codes"
2. My first python script for this project is titled "james_directional_v2.py". This initial script used a limited number of tokens, but the project entails screening all tokens on an exchange.

Tasks:
1. Develop a reliable and stable directional bot based on predefined conditions, i.e., continuously screen all tokens on an exchange (e.g., Binance_perpetual), print out tokens that meet trade conditions (either long or short) in the order of priority and execute trade.
2. Review the code to ensure connectors and executors meet the acceptance criteria, reporting and other requirements.
3. Perform automated and manual testing.
4. Work with client to optimize and host bot on a cloud server. Monitor bot performance over a period.
5. Enable Telegram reporting and control.
